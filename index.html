<p style="font-size: 30px;">Eimy is the most precious woman in my life. She’s beautiful, cute, and honestly the woman I love the most. I love her strong, admirable personality—it makes her perfect for me. I love how she laughs on the dumb things i did or silly words I said to her. I love how her eyes light up when she’s happy or when she does well at something. She’s just so special that I don’t think even she realizes how lovable she is. That’s why I want to take responsibility for her—not just in loving her, but in everything. People say that finding someone else is better than waiting, but how can I find someone better when she’s already the best.
